**Reproducibility Package for Demir and Apel (2025)**

This repository contains the data and programs to reproduce tables and figures in "Recorded Justice or Procedural Justice? A Randomized Controlled Experiment of the Influence of Body Worn Cameras and Officer Behavior on Citizen Attitudes," which appears in *Justice Quarterly*. This is a study of XXX.

The data and program folders include the raw data acquired from YouGov as a Stata dataset (RUTG0003\_OUTPUT.dta), with an accompanying Stata do-file that performs all statistical analyses (stata-analysis.do). They also include CSV files that record the callback estimates from prior criminal record hiring experiments (prior-audits.csv, prior-surveys.csv), in addition to the YouGov outcome data (yougov-callback.csv), with an accompanying R script that produces all visualizations (r-visualizations.R). The pre-publication version of the manuscript is included in a separate folder.
